### Macular Degeneration

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) distinguishes two types: dry AMD, which is more common, develops gradually and can lead to some loss of vision, and wet AMD, which develops much faster and can lead to more comprehensive vision loss. With specialized diagnostics and therapy, including medication, laser coagulation or vitrectomy, we can positively influence the course of the disease.

### Diabetic Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can lead to vision loss. It is caused by vascular damage due to prolonged elevated blood sugar levels. The altered metabolism damages the vessels in the kidneys, brain, and eye. Early diagnosis and treatment, including laser coagulation of the retina or in combination with intravitreal injections, is crucial to preserve vision.

### Cataract (Grey Star)

Eye disease in which one or both eye lenses become cloudy. Vision deteriorates and details are seen blurry. The cause is the natural aging of the lens. The treatment is done through a cataract operation, which is usually possible without complications.

### Vitreous Opacity (Mouches Volantes)

Clouding of the vitreous in the eye. You see flying mosquitoes or black dots moving back and forth. Causes are myopia, age over 50, diabetes, and high blood pressure. The treatment is done through a vitrectomy, a minimally invasive procedure. The opacities and part of the vitreous are removed and replaced with a clear liquid.

### Vitreous Detachment

A normal age-related phenomenon in which the vitreous detaches from the retina in the back of the eye. The disease is not associated with pain and does not lead to loss of vision, but it causes some disturbances that are perceived as annoying. Causes are age-related shrinkage of the vitreous and pathological myopia. Usually, no treatment is required, but observation and regular checks are important.

## Intravitreal Injections

Intravitreal injections are an innovative approach in the treatment of eye diseases. A drug is injected directly into the vitreous of the eye. This allows targeted therapy of diseases of the retina and the macula.

Intravitreal injections can be used for various eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and retinal diseases.

## Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT)
{: layout="use: #sec-card-2col"}

> Treatment to lower intraocular pressure

Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is a gentle laser treatment to lower intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma. With the latest diagnostic procedures, we can detect changes in the macula early and treat them specifically.

Comprehensive education about the possibilities and a planned coordinated concept for treatment is important to us. We work closely with you to ensure the best possible therapy for your individual needs.

### Glaucoma (Green Star)

High intraocular pressure, which can damage the optic nerve and restrict the visual field. In the worst case, it leads to blindness. The cause is when the natural outflow of aqueous humor in the so-called chamber angle is disturbed. The treatment is usually done with eye drops that lower the pressure inside the eye. It can also be treated with a laser procedure (SLT or YAG iridotomy) or surgery (trabeculectomy).

### Intraocular Pressure

Pressure exerted by the aqueous humor inside the eye to the outside. Normal values are between 10mmHg and 21mmHg. Triggers for increased intraocular pressure: diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, too low or too high blood pressure, genetic disposition
