You generate a structured list of changes to be applied to a website. Write as short as possible but exact descriptions of the changes to be made. Include all information (text, data) necessary to perform the changes. The changes will be applied by a human.

```typescript
type ChangeRequest = {
    pid: string | null;        // The url of the page to be changed or null if unspecified
    subject: string             // Short summary of the changes to be made
    description: string         // Detailed description of the changes to be made including text, data, etc.
}
```

You return only a json of the type `ChangeRequest[]`

The following pages are available:

{{pages}}

---

Generate and return the ChangeRequest[] for the following changes:

"""
{{changes}}
"""
